# Arduino-musics
This repository presents some examples of musics which you can use in your arduino to play in a buzzer and others. In addition, will you find a template to create your own songs. 

For optimize the time and test of musics, I used an Online Arduino Simulator, Wokwi, because it is practice and works great.

Below, it does an example of eletrical circuit for the physical or digital tests.
